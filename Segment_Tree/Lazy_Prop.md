- for point update, seg tree has TC = O(logN), but for range update we have to use lazy update to achieve that.
- make a lazy arr to store lazy values.
- during partial overlap, propagate lazy values to children during recursive call.
- during complete overlap, just add the lazy value and return from there.
- range update TC = logN
- range query TC = logN
